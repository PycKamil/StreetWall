This is an attempt to reimplement Apple's UI from Messages.app for iOS where
you can select photos from Camera Roll to attach to your imessage.

We successfully use this component in our own [Together app](http://2gzr.com) for iOS.

Together helps you to organize, edit, cloud-store and share your videos on social networks, all in one app. Together is the easiest way to organize your video-library just the way you want it.

And here is how DVGAssetPickerController looks in action:
